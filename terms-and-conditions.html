      <h1>Terms and Conditions for Turnix</h1>
      <p><em>Effective Date: 11 August 2025</em></p>

      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of Turnix, a mobile
        puzzle game provided by codeness.ly (“we”, “our”, or “us”). By accessing
        or using Turnix, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Use of the Game</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may use Turnix solely for personal, non-commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          You agree not to reverse engineer, modify, distribute, or exploit the
          game or its content beyond the permitted usage.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Accounts and Authentication</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix uses Apple Game Center (iOS) and Google Play Games Services
        (Android) for authentication and saving progress across devices. You are
        responsible for maintaining access to your platform account.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Online Duels and Multiplayer</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix includes optional online duels. By using multiplayer features,
        you agree to the following additional terms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Matchmaking: We may use factors such as region, connection quality,
          play history, and skill/rating to create fair matches. Matchmaking is
          not guaranteed and may vary with player availability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fair Play and Anti-Cheat: You must not exploit bugs, use unauthorized
          tools, modify the client, or disrupt opponent gameplay. We may use
          reasonable technical measures to detect and prevent cheating and
          abuse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Conduct: Harassment, discriminatory behavior, or griefing is
          prohibited. While the game does not include public chat features, your
          account may be actioned for abusive conduct observed through gameplay
          patterns or platform reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connectivity: Online play requires a stable internet connection and
          may use data from your provider. Disconnections may result in losses
          or penalties within the game at our discretion to preserve fairness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Availability: Online services may be unavailable from time to time due
          to maintenance, updates, or factors beyond our control. We do not
          guarantee uninterrupted multiplayer service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enforcement: We may suspend or restrict access to multiplayer for rule
          violations, repeated disconnects, or suspected cheating.
        </li>
      </ul>
