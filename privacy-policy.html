      <h1>Privacy Policy for Turnix</h1>
      <p><em>Effective Date: 11 August 2025</em></p>
      <p>Thank you for playing Turnix — a pattern-matching puzzle game.</p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Turnix ("we", "our", or "us")
        collects, uses, and protects your information.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect personally identifiable information directly. However,
        Turnix integrates with third-party game services to support features
        like saving progress across devices.
      </p>
      <h3>a. Platform Authentication Services</h3>
      <p>We use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple Game Center</strong> (iOS)</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Games Services</strong> (Android)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services authenticate players and provide a secure way to save
        progress across devices. When you sign in through these services:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your platform-provided player ID and public profile (e.g., display
          name, avatar) may be accessed by the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not access or store any personal information beyond what is
          necessary to enable these features.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can manage your permissions through your device settings.</p>

      <h2>2. Online Duels and Multiplayer</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix now offers optional online duels. To enable real-time play,
        limited information is processed to establish and maintain a network
        session, perform matchmaking, and keep gameplay fair.
      </p>
      <h3>a. Data Processed for Online Play</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Platform player identifiers and public profile details you have made
          available via Apple Game Center or Google Play Games Services (e.g.,
          display name, avatar).
        </li>
        <li>
          Matchmaking and session data, such as region, skill/rating, lobby or
          match IDs, and timing information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Connection metadata transmitted as part of normal internet
          communication (e.g., IP address, latency, packet loss) used to route
          traffic and improve connectivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gameplay state synchronization and basic telemetry required to ensure
          both players see the same game state in real time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Limited anti-cheat and safety signals (for example, repeated
          disconnects or integrity flags) to detect and prevent abuse.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>b. Storage and Retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Online duel data is primarily processed transiently for the duration
          of a match. We do not maintain player communications or audio/video
          recordings (no in-game chat features are provided).
        </li>
        <li>
          We may retain minimal logs (e.g., match outcomes, enforcement events)
          for a limited period to operate matchmaking, rankings/leaderboards
          provided by platform providers, and to protect players from abuse.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>c. Networking and Service Providers</h3>
      <p>
        Online connectivity may use services provided by platform providers or
        networking/relay providers. As traffic traverses the internet, data may
        be routed through servers in various regions, subject to those
        providers' privacy practices.
      </p>
      <h3>d. Legal Bases</h3>
      <p>
        We process the above information to perform the service you request
        (provide online duels) and under our legitimate interests to maintain a
        fair, secure experience.
      </p>
      <h3>e. Controls</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can opt out by not using online features; offline play remains
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manage platform profile visibility and permissions via your device
          settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. User-Generated Content (UGC) – Planned Feature</h2>
      <p>In future updates, players may be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create custom puzzles.</li>
        <li>Submit them for review.</li>
        <li>
          Have approved puzzles featured in a public "Community Puzzles"
          section.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you submit a puzzle:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your submission will not be linked to your identity unless you choose
          to include a public display name.
        </li>
        <li>
          All content must comply with our submission guidelines (to be
          published with the feature).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Rights Over Shared Patterns</h2>
      <p>
        If you submit a custom puzzle or pattern through the Community Puzzles
        feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You retain ownership of the content you create.</li>
        <li>
          By submitting, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
          sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, and
          distribute your pattern within the game and related promotional
          materials.
        </li>
        <li>
          This license is perpetual and allows us to showcase your submission to
          other players.
        </li>
        <li>You may not submit content you do not have the rights to share.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will not associate your real name or identity with any published
        content unless you explicitly provide a public display name.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix uses Apple Game Center and Google Play Games Services for
        authentication, cloud saves, and identity in multiplayer contexts. We
        may also rely on networking or relay services to facilitate online
        connectivity. We do not integrate third-party analytics or advertising
        SDKs at this time.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Turnix is not directed toward children under 13, and we do not knowingly
        collect personal data from them. Parents can control Game Center and
        Play Games access through device parental controls.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        All authentication and cloud save operations are handled securely
        through platform providers. For online duels, gameplay data is
        transmitted over secure channels and processed as needed to maintain a
        match. We do not operate persistent player profile databases on our own
        servers.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy at any
        time. When we do, we will update the Effective Date above and notify you
        via the app or app store update notes. Continued use of Turnix after
        changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>
